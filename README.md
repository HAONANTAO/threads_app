# **Description**

The Mock Threads can do lots of features like the real society application.

The Mock Threads app offers a range of features that mimic the functionality of real social media platforms, providing an engaging and interactive experience for users. Users can create threads, where they can post content, share their thoughts, or ask questions. These threads can be categorized by topics or communities, allowing users to find discussions that align with their interests.

In addition to creating threads, users can interact with others by liking posts, commenting, and reposting content. The app also includes a feature for sharing posts on external platforms, broadening the reach of popular discussions. The threading system allows for nested replies, making it easy for users to engage in focused conversations.

A key feature of the app is its social connectivity; users can follow other accounts, receive updates on new posts, and engage in private conversations through direct messages. Users can also customize their profiles with personal images and bio information, creating a more personalized experience.

# **Version**ï¼š

Version 1: the basic user,thread and communities functions

Version 2: make more improvements: social media link, repost, share etc...

# **Prerequisites**ï¼š

**Node.js**: To run this project, you need to have Node.js installed. The project is developed and tested on Node.js version `v18.0.0` and above. You can download the latest stable release from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

**Package Managers**: The project uses npm (which comes pre-installed with Node.js) or yarn for managing dependencies. If you prefer yarn, you can install it globally with the command `npm install -g yarn`. Using one of these package managers is essential for installing the necessary project dependencies.

**Clerk API Key**: Since the project integrates with Clerk for authentication, you'll need to obtain an API key from the [Clerk platform](https://clerk.dev/). After you get the key, use the `dotenv` package to securely store the API key as an environment variable in your local development setup.

**MongoDB**: This project requires MongoDB for backend data storage. You can install the [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) locally and ensure that itâ€™s running. The `mongoose` library is used to interact with the database, and it is critical for backend data storage and retrieval.

**Backend Dependencies**: In the root directory of the project, run `npm install` to install the backend dependencies. These dependencies include libraries such as `axios` for making HTTP requests, `bcrypt` for hashing passwords, `express` for handling the backend server, and `mongoose` for interacting with MongoDB, all of which are specified in the `package.json` file.

**Frontend Dependencies**: For the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm install`. This will install frontend dependencies such as `react` and `react-dom` for building user interfaces, as well as UI libraries like `@mui/material` for UI components, along with other necessary packages for styling and functionality.

# **Quick_Start**ï¼š

### **Clone the Repository**

- Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then run the following Git command:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/HAONANTAO/threads_app.git
  cd Mock_AI_ChatBot
  ```



### Install Dependencies

- For both the front-end and back-end, run `npm i` in the root project directory. This will install all the packages listed in the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections of the `package.json` files for both parts of the application.
- The back-end uses packages like `axios`, `bcrypt`, and `express` for handling HTTP requests, user authentication, and server setup respectively. The front-end depends on libraries such as `react`, `@mui/material` for building the user interface.

```
npm install
```



### Running the Code

- Start the Backend first then running the Frontend.

  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

  

# **Features**ï¼š

ðŸ‘‰ **Post & Thread Management:**

- You fetch posts (threads) by pagination, ensuring top-level threads are retrieved.
- Threads can have comments (children), and the system supports recursion to fetch all replies.
- You can create, delete, and fetch individual threads, including all child threads and their replies.

**ðŸ‘‰User Management:**

- You can fetch, update, and manage user profiles (including bio, image, and name).
- The system supports fetching posts made by the user and replies (thread interactions).
- User search supports pagination and sorting based on creation date.

**ðŸ‘‰Community Management:**

- Communities can be created, members added, and posts within communities are fetched with threads and their respective replies.
- The system allows searching for communities by name or username, with pagination support.
- You handle community memberships by adding/removing users from communities.
