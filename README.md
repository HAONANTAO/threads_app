### **Clone the Repository**

- Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then run the following Git command:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/HAONANTAO/GameHub.git
  cd Mock_AI_ChatBot
  ```



### Install Dependencies

- For both the front-end and back-end, run `npm i` in the root project directory. This will install all the packages listed in the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections of the `package.json` files for both parts of the application.
- The back-end uses packages like `axios`, `bcrypt`, and `express` for handling HTTP requests, user authentication, and server setup respectively. The front-end depends on libraries such as `react`, `@mui/material` for building the user interface.

```
npm install
```



### Running the Code

- Start the Backend first then running the Frontend.

  ```
  npm run dev
  ```
